# About
CrubWM is a hobby project, who's sole purpose is for me to learn how the X protocol works and use it to implement a window manager, in Rust of course. It is still by all means, a work in progress and a mess. See the [TOOD](#todo) section to see what is done and what awaits further attention.

# TODO
- [x] tiling window management with extensible layouts
- [x] basic keybinds and action support(switching focused clients, moving clients between workspaces, switching workspaces etc...)
- [ ] multiple monitor support
- [x] floating windows
- [ ] graphics, text and window decorations
- [ ] more configuration options
- [ ] bar
- [ ] EWMH and ICCC compliance
- [x] startup hooks
- [ ] config reloading on the fly
